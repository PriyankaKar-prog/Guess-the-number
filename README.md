Guess the Number Game

A beginner-friendly Python project where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. This simple terminal-based game is great for learning the basics of Python programming.

How It Works

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is asked to guess the number.
After each guess, the program tells whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct.
The game continues until the user guesses correctly.

How to Run

Make sure Python is installed. Then:

```bash
python 26_guesstheno_game.py
